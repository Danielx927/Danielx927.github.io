### ðŸ§® Whac-A-MOLE  

**Programming Language**: Java  

**Description**:  
The game I developed with my project team, Whac-A-Mole, is built using Java in the Eclipse IDE, leveraging the libGDX game engine. This game combines classic arcade-style gameplay with an educational twistâ€”players are challenged to solve math equations by "whacking" the mole that displays the correct answer. As players progress, the difficulty of the equations increases, promoting engagement and reinforcing arithmetic skills in a fun and interactive way. This project aims to make learning math more enjoyable, especially for younger audiences, while demonstrating how games can be both entertaining and educational.

**Features**:
- Progressive Difficulty
- Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
